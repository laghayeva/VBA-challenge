Module 2 Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains a VBA script used to analyze stock data for multiple quarters. The script calculates key metrics including:

- **Quarterly Change**
- **Percent Change**
- **Total Stock Volume**
- **Greatest % Increase**
- **Greatest % Decrease**
- **Greatest Total Volume**

The script also applies conditional formatting to the 'Quarterly Change' and the 'Percent Change' columns and adjusts column widths.

## Code Source

The code was developed by me (Liaman Aghayeva) based on instructions and some research for proper syntax. The script is available in the 'Module_2_Challenge_VBA_Code.bas' file.
